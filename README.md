# lastSoldier
The last soldier is a puzzle. you take one random pieced out of the game, then you need to take pieces one by one only by jumping over it like you do in checkers.

I got this puzzle as a gift in a Secret Santa (Giant/Dwarf) Purim game from some one who hates me.

First it seemed easy, then it seemed impossible, so I had to write some code that will solve this for me.
